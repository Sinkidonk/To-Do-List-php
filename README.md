# To Do List php
 Moved from Advance-PHP repository
 
 I put many long hours into coding this project.
 
 Please note at this time I do not recommend people put a real password into this project.
 
 I do have the password encrypted; however, I do not have them salted.
 
 Out of everything I have done in the world of web coding.
 
 This project I am the proudest of, well this and the portfolio website, I am slowly working on and building upon.
 
 The project currently live at http://apollo.gtc.edu/~aparys/adv-php/final-project/index.php
 
 However due to the passage of time all of the related database backend been deleted off this server.
 Making the whole project worthless.
 
 I am currently in the process of getting the funds together to create a new web hosting, that will serve my portfolio, and my old code expectally this project.
